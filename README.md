# blender-< as a >-pipeline (BAAP)

Template pipeline for individual, small-team sized Blender project development.

This uses Docker to run a small image of blender into a Github Action that has staged rendering.
The Stages in rendering are tightly coupled with the animator's workflow in mind.

# Quick start

## Prerequisites:
Needed to be installed/configured on your local machine.
 - python3
    - pyyaml
 - blender
 - docker
    - You may run `./scripts/install_docker_linux.sh` if you are using a linux machine.


## Set Up
A stage is a specific rendering configuration, details in `config.yaml`, consisting of at least one blender file to be rendered.
The information held in such a stage includes:

```yaml
scene:
  buffer_frames: 1-9,11-20      # frames 1 through 20 except 10
  force_update: false           # force frame to rerender, even if file exists
  render_output: 'imgs/buffer/' # where to put the output of that file
  engine: CYCLES                # EEVEE support coming soon
  blend_file: scene.blend       # the blend file in question
  render_format: PNG            # what format the output should be in
  docker_flags: ''              # parameters for blender to be used in the docker call
```

In this project, Stage `scene` refers to the blend file that contains the models/textures to be build, and stage `edit` includes the blender file with post processing.

## Render
0. Set up the Docker image locally (this will take some time).
```bash
docker build -t blender-pipeline scripts/
```

1. If you just downloaded this project, first set the paths of your working directory.

```bash
make set_paths
# or make set_paths_mac (for mac users)
```

You can verify the output of this with `make get_paths` and `make get_paths_mac`

2. Render the scene stage
```bash
make scene_render
```

3. Render the post processing stage (edit)
```bash
make edit_render
```

Raw, individual frames will populate in imgs/buffer/ without post processing.
A video file will be found in imgs/out/ with post processing.
