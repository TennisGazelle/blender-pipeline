This uses Docker to run a small image of blender into a Github Action that has staged rendering.
The Stages in rendering are tightly coupled with the animator's workflow in mind.

**Docker Container:** https://hub.docker.com/r/tennisgazelle/blender-pipeline

# Quick start

### Prerequisites:
Needed to be installed/configured on your local machine.
 - python3
    - pyyaml
 - blender (technically optional)
 - docker
    - You may run `./scripts/install_docker_linux.sh` if you are using a linux machine.


### Set Up
Copy this repo's contents to your projects workdir.
Place your blender files into `blender/` and your image resource files into `imgs/resources`.  Be sure to relink everything.

#### Terminology - "Stage"
A stage is a specific rendering configuration, details in `config.yaml`, consisting of at least one blender file to be rendered.
The information held in such a stage includes:

```yaml
scene:
  buffer_frames: 1-9,11-20      # frames 1 through 20 except 10
  force_update: false           # force frame to rerender, even if file exists
  render_output: 'imgs/buffer/' # where to put the output of that file
  engine: CYCLES                # EEVEE support coming soon
  blend_file: scene.blend       # the blend file in question
  render_format: PNG            # what format the output should be in
  blender_flags: ''             # parameters for blender to be used in the docker call
file_output_format: '{bfile}_{stage}_####'
```

> for `blender_flags:`, use flags found for blender arguments [found here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/arguments.html)

> `file_output_format` arguments:
> Arg | Desc
> -- | --
> `bfile` | Blender file
> `stage` | Name of stage
> `####` | Frame number

In this project, Stage `scene` refers to the blend file that contains the models/textures to be build, and stage `edit` includes the blender file with post processing.

#### Terminology - "Model"
A model is reference to an OBJ file outputted by a 3D modeler, void of static (image) and dynamic (procedural) texture information.  A model may be autorendered in turnstyle format based on configuration as defaulted below:

```yaml
models:
  - cool_cube:
    obj_file: 'blender/models/curve-skeleton-cube.obj'
    render_output: 'imgs/out/models/'
    scaling_factor: 1 # default (1)
    remove_doubles: true # default (false)
    edge_split: false # default (false)
    depth_scale: 1.4 # default (1.4)
    color_depth: 8 # default (8)
    format: PNG # default PNG
    video: false # default (false); if true, format is ____ and rotation_iteration will be 5 sec rotation at 30 fps (150)
    resolution: 600 # is square; default (600)
    rotation_iterations: 30 # default 6
    include:
      - color # default only one active
      - depth
      - normal
      - albedo
      - id
model_output_format: '{model}_{angle}_{map}
```

> `model_output_format` arguments:
> Arg | Desc
> -- | --
> `model` | name of model (ex. 'cool_cube')
> `objfile` | Object file
> `angle` | Angle of Camera [0-360)
> `map` | which type of map it is (see `models.MODEL_NAME.include` options)

In this project, `cool_cube` is the shape found in `blender/cool_scene.blend`. 

### Render
0. (optional) Set up the Docker image locally (this will take some time).
```bash
docker build -t blender-pipeline scripts/
```

You can also just download the image to save time
```bash
docker pull tennisgazelle/blender-pipeline:latest
```

1. If you just downloaded this project, first set the paths of your working directory.

```bash
make set_paths
```

You can verify the output of this with `make get_paths`

2. Render the scene stage
```bash
make scene_render
```

3. Render the post processing stage (edit)
```bash
make edit_render
```

Raw, individual frames will populate in imgs/buffer/ without post processing.
A video file will be found in imgs/out/ with post processing.
